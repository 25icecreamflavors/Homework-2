# Workshop 2
## Discovering sorting algorithms
This task required to realize Insertion, Merge, Quick sort of vectors or doubly linked lists of integers or strings and required to realize Counting, Radix (base 2, 10) sort for vectors of integers. Then, one has to collect time data via implemented functions and visualize it using pyplot.
## Summary
Problem2.cpp contains c++ code for this task. Folder visualization contains graph files, data files in csv format and python code for graphs.
